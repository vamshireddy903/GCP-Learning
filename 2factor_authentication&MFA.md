# Authentication & Authorization
Authentication verifies a user's identity (who you are) using credentials like passwords or biometrics, while authorization determines their access permissions (what you can do) after logging in

 Authentication always occurs first, followed by authorization to restrict

# Authentication Examples:  
- Entering a username and password to log in.  
- Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) via a OTP (one-time password) sent to a phone.  
- Using biometric verification like FaceID or fingerprint scanning.  
- Single Sign-On (SSO) methods.

# Authorization Examples:  
- A manager accessing company financial reports, while a regular employee cannot.  
- An email user only accessing their own inbox.  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in software, such as "Read-Only" vs. "Edit" permissions.  
- Granting a third-party application permission to access your contact list.
