# Migration
In the world of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), migration is the process of moving your data, applications, and workloads from an "on-premises" environment (your own physical servers) or another cloud provider (like AWS or Azure) into Google’s infrastructure.

- 🖥️ On-premises data center  
- ☁️ Another cloud (AWS, Azure, etc.)  
- 🧪 Old VM / legacy environment inside GCP itself

**What can be migrated to GCP**  
 **1️⃣ Compute (Servers / VMs)**

Moving physical servers or virtual machines into GCP.

**Examples:**

- On-prem VMware → GCE VM  
- AWS EC2 → GCE VM  

**GCP tools:**

- Migrate to Virtual Machines
- VM import/export

**2️⃣ Applications**

Moving applications running on those servers.

Types:

- Lift & Shift – move as-is (no code change)   
- Re-platform – small changes (e.g., move to managed DB)  
- Re-architect – redesign using cloud-native services

**Examples:**

- Monolithic app → GKE (Kubernetes)  
- Java app → App Engine / Cloud Run

**3️⃣ Databases & Data**

Moving data from existing databases or storage.

**Examples:**

- MySQL on EC2 → Cloud SQL  
- On-prem DB → Cloud Spanner

**GCP tools:**

- Database Migration Service  
- Storage Transfer Service  
- Transfer Appliance (for huge data)

**4️⃣ Networking**

Re-creating your network in GCP.

Includes:

- VPCs  
- Subnets  
- Firewall rules  
- VPN / Interconnect

**5️⃣ Identity & Access**

Moving or integrating users and permissions.

Examples:

- LDAP / AD → Cloud Identity  
- IAM role mapping from AWS/Azure → GCP IAM roles

**Why do companies migrate to GCP?**

💰 Lower cost / better pricing for some workloads  
- Switching from capital expenses (buying hardware) to operational expenses (pay-as-you-go).

🤖 AI / ML services (BigQuery, Vertex AI)
- Innovation: Getting instant access to Google’s AI and BigQuery data analytics tools.

📈 Auto-scaling & managed services  
- Scalability: Handling 10 users or 10 million users without buying new servers.
